Metric,Computation Frequency,Reporting Frequency,Relevant Tracking Methods,Rationale for Frequency
Latency (Response Time),Daily,Daily,"Mean latency, Time per token","Since the system runs once per day, latency should be computed and reported daily to detect performance issues within each batch run."
Throughput (Requests per Second),Daily,Daily,"Total requests processed per batch, Batch processing time",Throughput should be measured daily to understand the system's processing efficiency and potential delays in batch execution.
Token Consumption,Daily,Daily,"Total tokens used, Input vs. output token ratio'","Token usage should be tracked daily to monitor batch-level cost and performance, ensuring efficient prompt engineering."
Output Drift,Daily,Weekly,"Embedding distance (Cosine Similarity, KL Divergence), Jensen-Shannon divergence","Drift should be computed daily to detect changes across batches, but reporting weekly prevents false positives from minor variations."
Decision Traceability,Daily,On demand,"Intermediate LLM reasoning steps, Chain-of-thought logging","Tracking daily ensures transparency in reasoning, but analysis should be on demand for debugging."
Field Highlighting,Daily,On demand,"Highlight mappings of input text to JSON fields, Span alignment tracking",Field Highlighting maps specific portions of the input text directly to JSON fields.Matches words in the input to the extracted JSON fieldShould be computed daily to enable explainability but reported only when necessary.
Field-Level Accuracy,Daily,Weekly,"Precision, recall, F1-score per field, Mismatch rate for expected vs. generated fields",Field-level accuracy should be tracked daily but reported weekly to analyze broader accuracy trends.
Perplexity Monitoring,Daily,Weekly,"Model perplexity on recent inputs, Perplexity trend over time, Deviation from expected perplexity","Perplexity Monitoring tracks how uncertain the model is when generating outputs. A higher perplexity means the model finds the input unexpected or difficult.Daily tracking detects model uncertainty, but weekly reporting provides a more stable trend analysis."
Input Data Drift,Daily,Weekly,"Token distribution shift, Word frequency drift, Semantic embedding shifts, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for text feature distributions",Input drift should be tracked daily per batch but reported weekly to prevent overreacting to transient variations.
A/B Testing Metrics,On model update,On model update,"Comparison of model versions on batch outputs, Evaluation of JSON field-level accuracy",A/B testing is relevant only during model updates and should be computed and reported at that time.
